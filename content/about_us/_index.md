Inspired by Sir J.C. Bose, recognized as the father of radio and wireless communication, we're a team of zealous and ambitious engineers working on the state of the art communication technologies and highly advanced AI/ML algorithms with a mission to connect remotely accessible locations and provide highly secure as well as intelligent end-to-end solutions of entire sensor networks to cater to industrial as well as personal needs.  

With the perpetually increasing demand for data to reduce human intervention  there arises a need for firstly, the data gathering. Secondly, data communication and thirdly, data processing. There always remains a missing link between the three aforementioned stages where Bosecom Tech steps up to bridge the gap by delivering and integrating each of these stages to create the final solutions.

Our end-to-end solutions use highly secure data communication networks for the M2M communication and the advanced AI/ML algorithms to process the data to increase the efficiency of end-user operation inturn eventually leading to reduced cost of operations and optimum resource usage.
