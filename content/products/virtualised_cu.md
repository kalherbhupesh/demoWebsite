5G is here. ​5G is maturing and 5G is delivering upon the promises ​it made.​ But, 5G has more potential to realize. Bosecom provides a highly robust and high performing 5G CU while planning for future network topologies and ideologies.

## What is 5G CU?

Gnb is splitted into CU(centralized unit) and DU(distributed unit) to bring flexible hardware And software components implementation. That would allow scalable, cost effective network Deployment. 
Higher protocol stack layers such as SDAP,PDCP,RRC will reside on CU. Some functionalities of CU are mobility control, radio access network sharing, session management  etc. 
Apart from some functionalities which are exclusively allocated to DU, CU controls the operation of DUs over the fronthaul interface.
Interface between  CU and DU is F1 interface which is an open interface so that CU can work with DUs of other vendors."

## Why deploy Bosecom's 5G CU?
- BoseCom provides highly scalable CU for small cell
- Each CU can support more than 100 DUs
- End to end security
