Objective

We predict failing of electric
motors in advance using our
sensor network and artificial
neural network. Motor can be
situated in remote places as
our state of the art LPWAN can
cover upto radius of 2 kms
while in open areas it could go
upto 5 kms. Sensor could be
placed in remote areas as our
they could be live upto 5 years
on single charge of battery
depending upon use case.
