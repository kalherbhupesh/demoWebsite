## CCTV Feed Analysis
- Our propriety algorithm are able to parse CCTV feed and analyse them for abnormal activities which we can modify according to our customers, for example use cases are defence and police application where these system could be used to detect violence and abnormal behaviour. We can avoid human observation feed and create a warning system that can provide high reliability removing human errors.

## Image Quality Analysis And Improvement
- 1)Videos can be analysed for their quality and this could be done with high efficiency better than methods available in market. This could be used by streaming platforms to generate a check on user end where good service is more important than slimness of app. Another use case of Algorithm can be as check on thousands of CCTV camera deployed for surveillance. Our algorithm can also increase the quality of frames if need arises to develop a detailed image using our proprietary algorithm.
- 2)Fisheyecamera images can be converted to plane images using our algorithm. Which makes it possible that input stream from Fisheye-camera could be analysed using face detection and other programs."

## Optical Flow Detection
- Optical Flow is 2d motion between two consecutive frames of a video. Optical data serves as the fundamental input for numerous computer vision and robotics application. In our project we worked on the current state of the art algorithm for optical flow detection. Use cases are Robot navigation, object tracking, Movement detection, visual odometer. It Can used to track movement of objects/person over a larger area with rotating cameras where the movement of camera is controlled by outputs of our program.

## Memory Reading Optimisation
- There are unavoidable bit flips in the memory. Whenever data is read from memory, ECC(Error correcting code) automatically triggers and correct these bit flips. However in certain cases this ECC doesn't triggers implicitly, So the application explicitly triggers ECC before Data is read from memory in that area only which would be used for data extraction. The application we created is very optimised in terms of time and space complexity.
