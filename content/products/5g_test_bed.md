5G Test-Bed 5G technology promises unparalleled connectivity for smart machines, augmented and virtual reality applications, and many other innovative uses. Thus, testing these experimental uses before their commercial rollout becomes an important aspect of innovation and entrepreneurship. Small-scale testing before a large rollout of a new use case identifies potential issues and facilitates innovation and entrepreneurship.We have experience in functional and conformance testing of 4G and NBIoT networks, we have developed our own stubs for test network elements like CU/DU or RU. We are  also working on UE simulator for end to end network testing.

## What is 5G Test-Bed?
Engineers test machine-to-machine 5G communication in a 5G testbed environment before a commercial rollout. This allows them to get a sense for how the network is performing in a reasonable approximation of real-world applications.

## Why use our 5G Test-Bed?
We provide a lean solution to test your network or subnetwork with highly modular solutions.The stubs we have designed could be used to test subunits of network like CU, RLC , MAC or PHY, we do conformational test, we check for 3GPP compliance, O-RAN compliance and also for functional test cases.We have our own DissectorsUE simulatorsStubs for PDCP, RRC, SDAP, RLC and MAC Exhaustive test case list based on O-RAN and 3GPP release 16.
